<b> RelaxedIK Solver </b>

Welcome to RelaxedIK! RelaxedIK is an inverse kinematics (IK) solver designed for robot platforms such that the conversion
between Cartesian end-effector pose goals (such as "move the robot's right arm end-effector to position X, while maintaining an end-effector
orientation Y") to Joint-Space (i.e., the robot's rotation values for each joint degree-of-freedom at a particular time-point) is
done both ACCURATELY and FEASIBLY.  By this, we mean that RelaxedIK attempts to find the closest possible solution to the
desired end-effector pose goals without exhibiting negative effects such as self-collisions, environment collisions,
kinematic-singularities, or joint-space discontinuities.

To start using the solver, please follow the step-by-step instructions in the file start_here.py (in the root directory)

If anything with the solver is not working as expected, or if you have any feedback, feel free to let us know! (rakita@cs.wisc.edu)
We are actively supporting and extending this code, so we are interested to hear about how the solver is being used and any positive or negative experiences in using it.
